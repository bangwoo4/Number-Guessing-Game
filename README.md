# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in C++. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player's goal is to guess this number.

## How to Play

1. Run the game. You will be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100.
2. Enter your guess. If your guess is too high or too low, the game will tell you so. You can then enter a new guess.
3. This process repeats until you guess the correct number. The game will then display a congratulatory message and tell you how many attempts it took you to guess the number.

## Building and Running the Game

This game is a single C++ file and can be built and run with any C++ compiler. For example, if you're using g++, you can build and run the game with the following command:


g++ NumberGuessing.cpp -o NumberGuessing && ./NumberGuessing
```
