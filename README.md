# Number Guessing Game

## Description
This is a simple number guessing game. The game generates a random number and the player's goal is to guess that number. The game offers different difficulty levels and the score is calculated based on the number of attempts and the chosen difficulty level.

## How to Play
1. Run the game.
2. Choose your difficulty level: easy, medium, hard, or extreme.
3. The game will generate a random number within a range depending on the chosen difficulty level.
4. Start guessing the number. After each guess, the game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
